                <h2>Fact 1: Extrovert Person </h2>
                <p> First of all, I am an extrovert who tends to be very talkative, sociable, active, and warm. I love social interactions so much! I want to get to know more people and their perspectives on life. I also have a time when I just want to be alone to regain myself and reflect. </p>

                <p> I love cats and dogs because they can make me stress-free for a moment when I am with them. We don't have a cat or dog, so sometimes I visit my friends houses just to see their pets after a stressful  week. </p>

                    <h2> I graduated from City of Bacoor National High School in San Nicolas with honors. </h2>
                    <p>In my junior high school journey, the 7th grade school year was the best because I met many friends who worked together academically. All my circle friends and I are among the top ten learners in the class, and I am very proud to be with them. In 8th and 9th grade, it was the worst school year that I ever had because of the pandemic. It was modular learning, and I really struggled, but this is where I started to be an honor student. In grade 10, it was the best but also the worst. Here I proved to myself that I can excel in the room, and I proved it because throughout the school year I was a consistent honor student until I graduated. </p>
